<p>A widespread pop culture myth predicts that any two individuals living in the world are six or fewer steps away and one can get acquainted with President Obama by a chain of acquaintances with less than five intermediaries. This idea was firstly proposed in 1929 by the Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy. For a number of years, the idea was articulated. Social scientists sought to prove the existence of short paths of social connections with empirical studies. It was until recently that researchers were able to formalize the concept behind this phenomenon as a small-world network. </p>

<p>A network is a type of mathematical graphs, where objects are referred as nodes or vertices, and objects are connected by links or edges. Two structural properties set a small-world network apart from a purely random network: clustering efficiency and average shortest path. Although both networks exhibit small average shortest path (S∝logN, where N is the number of nodes). A small-world network tends to have a significantly larger clustering coefficient (i.e., nodes are inclined to form larger clusters in which all or almost all nodes are connected). Many real-world natural and artificial systems exhibit the above mentioned small-world properties. Examples include brain neurons, social networks, power grids, and the internet. Due to its importance, visualization techniques for small-world networks have been extensively studied , but most of the previous works target expert users who already understand the properties of the network.</p>

<p>In this project, we present an explorable explanation of small-world networks, which introduces the basic concept and property trade-offs of small-world networks to novice users. We employ Watts–Strogatz model  to generate random small-world networks and allow users to specify generation parameters (i.e., the number of nodes, the mean degree and the clustering coefficient). We allow users to verify two of the most important properties of a small-world network: efficiency and robustness. Efficiency is indicated by the length of average shortest path, while robustness is measured by the change of average shortest path when one or more node fails (i.e., removed from the network). A complete network, where any pair of nodes are connected, is the most robust and efficient because the shortest path is 1 and there are excessive redundant links among nodes. However, such a network is often infeasible to build because the number of links grows quadratically with respect to the number of nodes. This is why natural evolution and most man-made systems opt for small-world networks, which avoid the overhead of complete networks by forming local clusters and eliminating most of the links among different clusters. </p>
